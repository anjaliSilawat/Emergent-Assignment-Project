Name: Anjali Silawat 
Role: Software Developer - In-House Vibe Builders  
Assignment: Vibe Check Quiz Website

Approach:  
I built a playful and responsive Vibe Check quiz website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design focuses on a smooth user experience with animations, a pink-themed aesthetic, and dynamic question navigation. It highlights selected answers, maintains state across navigation, and works well across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). 

I hosted the project using GitHub Pages for easy public access and sharing.
